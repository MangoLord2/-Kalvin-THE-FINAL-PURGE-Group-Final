THINGS TO NOTE (Future Assignment Descriptions):
{
This will be your submission page for your group's Beta Build check-in. This version of your game should have relatively finalized art and sound assets as well as a completely finalized level structure and polished mechanics. This submission should contain all of the following:

The most up to date version of your
GDD
Asset List
Trello
Unity Project Folder (Whatever is in your Repository's folder)
All files should be zipped up into a single zip folder and submitted all as one file. ONLY THE GAME DIRECTOR SHOULD BE SUBMITTING TO THIS ASSIGNMENT!!! Please ensure that you are only submitting one project per team. If I have multiple submissions of different versions of your game/documents, I will grade the most recent submission but I will take 5 points off. Remember, measure twice, cut once (double check and ensure you have the right files for your submission and then submit only when you're sure all of the proper files are included).

Good Luck Boys!
